<h2> Hi, I'm Arjun Singh!</h2>


### Look at this goofy code  

```javascript
const arjun = {
  pronouns: "he" | "him",
  code: [C++,Python, Javescript, Ruby, Rust, LUA, Rails ],
  tools: [Visual Studio 2022, Google Collab, 4,  Jest, Docker],
  architecture: ["Reactive/Real time", "event-driven", "design system pattern"],
 challenge: "Trying to develop my own game, alone :D"
}
```


 <em><b>I love connecting with different people</b> so if you want to say <b>hi, I'll be happy to meet you more!</b> :)</em>
